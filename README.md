# hello-world
My first repository
I'm Laurence, someone who cares about the world we live in, and wants to help, whether it's small-scale or large. We all have to do our part in making the world a better place for the children and people we leave it behind to. I think technology will play a bit part of that, so I'm learning to code to be more involved!

Wanting to learn Html, CSS, Python, and eventually Javascript.
